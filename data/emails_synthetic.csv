Given today's market moves, I wanted to share a quick update on our positioning. We're within risk limits and the hedges are performing as expected. No action needed but happy to discuss if anyone has questions.

My brother-in-law is on the board at MedDevice. He let slip that the FDA meeting went really well. Obviously don't tell anyone where you heard this.
